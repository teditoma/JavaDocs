1. Search all the employees from a department by the department name. The searching method will accept as parameter a String which will be part of the name of the department. (The department name should contain this string).

E.g.:
You have the departments: Administration and Construction.
If the method parameter is "STR", then all the employees from the departments Administration and Construction will be found.

Attention:
- The search should be case insesitive.
- You can use JOIN
- You are not restricted to a certain method signature

2. Create an insert method which takes a list of entities as parameter and executes them in a single transaction. 
Try a scenario where you inserted 2 or more entities with the same id.
